# 🚀 DevOps Portfolio – Muhammad Abdullah

## 👋 Introduction

I am a DevOps-focused IT professional with hands-on experience in containerisation, CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and monitoring. This portfolio showcases practical DevOps projects that demonstrate how I design, deploy, and maintain reliable systems used in real-world business environments.

My work focuses on **automation, reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency** rather than theory.
